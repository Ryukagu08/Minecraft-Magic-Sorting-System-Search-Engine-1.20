# Minecraft-Magic-Sorting-System-Search-Engine-1.20+

**This is a simple site with a search engine for all the groups and respective items used in the Minecraft mod "Magic Sorting System", updated and modified by the user pasegolsson for 1.20+**

**Since the original mod was discontinued in 1.16, this updated version works similarly with slight changes in the groups. This site was made by translating the config.json file info.**

**Feel free to check how the mod works [here](https://github.com/jhuckaby/magic-sorting-system).**
